A Python Package Noncollinear Optical Parametric Amplification Simulation

In this original version, it contains a simulation program for noncollinear optical parametric amplification(NOPA) process, which can be used to either OPA system design or study the process itself. This program now only takes high-order dispersion (Up to 4th) into considersion. However, I will soon add more terms like walk-off effect, diffraction or parasitic fluorescence. 
The package can be used and modified freely. Any problems and advice are welcome, you can contact me through phygfli@gmail.com.
